# Aerofit-Descriptive-Statistics-and-Probability
The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience
for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the
treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences
across the product with respect to customer characteristics.
1. Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product
by developing appropriate tables and charts.
2. For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all
conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.

#Approach:
Importing the dataset and doing usual data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset.
Detecting Outliers (using boxplot, “describe” method by checking the difference between mean and median).
Checking if features like marital status, age have any effect on the product purchased (using countplot, histplots, boxplots etc).
Representing the marginal probability like - what percent of customers have purchased KP281, KP481, or KP781 in a table.
Checking correlation among different factors using heat maps or pair plots.
Performing descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
For each AeroFit treadmill product, constructing two-way contingency tables and computing all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.
With all the above steps we can answer questions like: What is the probability of a male customer buying a KP781 treadmill?
Customer Profiling - Categorization of users.
Findind various probabilities- marginal, conditional probability.
Giving recommendations and actionable insights, based on the inferences.
